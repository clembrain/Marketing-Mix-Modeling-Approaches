# üìä Marketing Mix Modeling Enhanced with Machine Learning

## [Time Series Adventure](https://github.com/clembrain/Marketing-Mix-Modeling-Approaches) 

## üöÄ Project Overview

This project introduces a hybrid analytics framework designed to overcome the limitations of traditional Marketing Mix Modeling (MMM) by integrating modern machine learning techniques. It delivers enhanced attribution accuracy, real-time responsiveness, and predictive capabilities to optimize marketing strategy and return on investment (ROI).

Using a rich marketing dataset from Conjura, the solution models revenue impact across multiple digital platforms (Google, Meta, TikTok), implements classification for high-revenue periods, and performs budget optimization simulations for marketing efficiency.

## üìö Key Features

- **Machine Learning Models**: Implements XGBoost, Random Forest, Ridge, and Linear Regression for revenue prediction and classification tasks.
- **SHAP Interpretability**: Uses SHAP (SHapley Additive Explanations) to decode model decisions and identify top predictive features.
- **Multi-Touch Attribution**: Breaks down the contribution of impressions, clicks, and spend from various channels.
- **Budget Optimization**: Simulates reallocation strategies and applies constrained optimization to maximize ROI.
- **Time Series Forecasting**: Utilizes SARIMA to forecast long-term revenue trends and seasonal cycles.
- **Scenario Testing**: Tests different "what-if" marketing strategies to guide decision-making.
