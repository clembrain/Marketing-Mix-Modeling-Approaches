### INTRODUCTION
As a database developer consultant for a hospital, I’m to create a complete database system that satisfies the needs of the customer. To effectively store and handle data on patients, medicaldoctor, medical records, appointments and departments, the hospital is creating a new database system. Particular client requirements were obtained at the first meeting in order to make sure that the database system meets the demands of both patients and healthcare practitioners. By making patient registration, appointment scheduling, medical record administration, and feedback gathering easier, this database system will expedite healthcare operations and enhance patient care.
In this task the first step I’ve decided to take is to prepare an ER proposed database design into 3NF, with the Entities, attributes and the relationships between them, taking into consideration the principles of database design which were thought in lecture. Below is the sketch of my proposed database tables and attributes.
